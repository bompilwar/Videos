HPA is used to add the pod in cluster 
Kubernetes supports horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA), which automatically adjusts the
number of pod replicas based on CPU or custom metrics. When a defined threshold is exceeded,
Kubernetes scales up or down by creating or terminating pods.

Install metrix server to run the top command to check the CPU and memory utilization 

kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods 

create an horizontal pod autoscaler yaml file and mention the load capacity 
hpa count will be incresed automatically 
kubectl get hpa
